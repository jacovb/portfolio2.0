# Project Portfolio 2.0

A collection of projects that I have worked on

## Description

This is a simplified version of my portfolio. The previous version, being inspired by the composition paintings of Mondrian, lacked some responsiveness and might have been too busy visually.

## What this app does?

- Introduces myself with links to my CV
- Shows projects that I've worked on, what technologies I've used, with links to the code on Github, as well as a live version of the app / website
- Provides my contact information and a Contact Form

## Credits:

- App created with NextJS and Tailwind CSS
- Contact Form supported by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- Icons by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
